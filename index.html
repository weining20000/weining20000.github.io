<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h2>

<p align="justify">I am a master's student in Data Science at the <a href="https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a> (GWU) under the supervision of <a href="https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/yuxiao-huang">Yuxiao Huang</a> (MS degree anticipated May 2020). I am experienced with data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using programming languages including <em>Python</em> and <em>R</em>. My machine learning expertise focuses on classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree; as well as deep learning algorithms including Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). </p>

<p align="justify">Before coming to GWU, I studied both Math and Asian Studies at <a href="https://www.kenyon.edu/">Kenyon College</a> (BA '14), and Asian Political Economy at the School of Foreign Service at <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University</a> (MA '16). From 2016 to 2018, I worked as a business intelligence analyst at two global risk and strategic consulting firms, <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en">Kroll Inc.,</a> (Washington DC, USA) and <a href="https://www.controlrisks.com/">Control Risks</a> (Shanghai, China). Through these experiences, I honed my analytical and writing skills through conducting pre-investment due diligence and political risk assessments for fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>2016 New York City Poverty Studies</strong><br>
<em>Role: EDA, ggplot2 visualization, Logistic Regression implementation, and results assessments</em><br>
This project built General Linear Regression (GLR) model and Random Forest using <em>R</em> as the programming language to predict poverty rates in New York City. Our findings show that Income, Unit Population, Family Type, Housing Type and Borough have the strongest predictive power for poverty status. Random Forest appears to be a better model in this instance with an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.9 and accuracy score of 84%.

<p align="justify"><strong>2017 Barcelona Traffic Accident Severity Prediction</strong><br>
<em>Role: data cleaning, EDA, and Random Forest implementation</em><br>
This project implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to explore the determinants of traffic accidents in Barcelona. Particularly, we examined how location, transportation type, time, and unemployment rate are correlated with traffic accidents. Both the Random Forest model and the Decision Tree model yielded a 90% accuracy, achieving better results than KNN.

<p align="justify"><strong>Flooding Damage Detection from Post-Harvey Hurricane Satellite Imagery based on CNN</strong><br>
<em>Role: project lead (pre-trained models implementation, performance matrices construction, and report writing)</em><br>
In this project, we desiged and trained a convolutional neural network from scratch and compared it with two existing neural networks, the <em>VGG-16</em> and <em>Resnet50</em>, for a binary classification problem (to differentiate images that contain flooding damages from the ones still intact.) Our best model (a custom CNN with fewer convolutional layers) was able to achieve an accuracy score of over 90% on the hold-out test set. We trained our networks using <em>PyTorch</em> as the framework with a single NVIDIA K80 Tesla GPU via the Google Cloud Platform.

<p align="justify"><strong>Malaria Infected Cell Classification via MLP</strong><br>
<em>Role: individual work</em><br>
This project built an MLP model using <em>Keras</em> as the framework to classify the blood cells into 4 different categories, which are: <em>red blood cell</em>, <em>ring</em>, <em>schizont</em>, and <em>trophozoite</em>. The best model over the seven-day data challenge competition (mid-term exam for Machine Learning II) has achieved a reasonable performance with a 0.6147 macro-averaged F1-score and 0.6212 Cohenâ€™s Kappa Score.

<p align="justify"><strong>Multi-Label Classification of Blood Cells Using CNN</strong><br>
<em>Role: individual work</em><br>
This project built a CNN model using <em>PyTorch</em> as the framework to recognize all types of cells that are present in the given images. These cell types are: <em>red blood cell</em>, <em>difficult</em>, <em>gametocyte</em>, <em>trophozoite</em>, <em>ring</em>, <em>schizont</em>, and <em>leukocyte</em>. The best model over the seven-day data challenge competition (final exam for Machine Learning II) yielded a loss score of 4.54085.

<p align="justify"><strong>2017 Global Merchandise Exports Using D3</strong><br>
<em>Role: individual work</em><br>
This project analyzes the 2017 export data across seven regions in the world. A chord diagram was constructed using D3 to visualize the export data for all seven regions in the world, displaying how merchandise products were exported from one source region to a destination.

<p align="justify"><strong>2019 World Wide Educational Attainment Tableau Dashboard</strong><br>
<em>Role: created a choropleth map, a line chart showing educational attainment difference between male and female, and a filter enabling user to view the data of a specific country</em><br>
This project analyzes the number of school years completed by individuals in the world. By using different interactive techniques and visualization graphics in Tableau, the dashboard presents to the audience the differences in educational attainment apparent in varied regions, income levels, and gender groups in the world.
