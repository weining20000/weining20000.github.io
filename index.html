<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h2>

<p align="justify">I am a master student majoring in Data Science at the <a href="https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/yuxiao-huang">Yuxiao Huang</a>. I am experienced with data wrangling and exploratory data analysis using programming languages including Python and R. My machine learning expertise focuses on classification algorithms such as logistic regression model, Random Forest, Decision Tree; as well as deep learning models including Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). </p>

<p align="justify">Before coming to George Washington University, I studied both Math and Asian Studies at <a href="https://www.kenyon.edu/">Kenyon College</a> (BA), and Asian Political Economies at the School of Foreign Service at <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/">Georgetwon University</a> (MA). From 2016 to 2018, I worked as a business intelligence analyst at two top-notch political risks consulting firms, <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en">Kroll Inc.</a> (Restion, VA) and <a href="https://www.controlrisks.com/">Control Risks</a> (Shanghai, China), where I honed my analytical and written skills by conducting pre-investment due diligence and political risk assessments for fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Flooding Damage Detection from Post-Hurricane Satellite Imagery based on CNN</strong><br>
Authors: Bixuan Huang and <strong>Weining Hu</strong><br>
In this project, we design and train a convolutional neural network from scratch and compare it with two existing neural networks, the VGG-16 and Resnet50, for a binary classification problem (to differentiate images that contain damages (i.e. flooding area or damaged buildings) from the ones still intact.) Our best model (a custom CNN with fewer layers) is able to achieve an accuracy of over 90% on the hold-out test set. We train our networks using the PyTorch framework with a single NVIDIA K80 Tesla GPU via Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

<p align="justify"><strong>Malaria Infected Cell Classification via MLP</strong><br>
Author: <strong>Weining Hu</strong><br>
This project used Keras to build an MLP model to classify the cells into 4 different categories, which are: “red blood cell”, “ring”, “schizont”, and “trophozoite.” The best model over the seven-day data challenge competition (mid-term exam for Machine Learning II) has achieved a reasonable performance with a 0.6147 macro-averaged F1-score and 0.6212 Cohen’s Kappa Score. The average score of the two is 0.6179.

<p align="justify"><strong>Multi-Label Classification of Blood Cells using CNN</strong><br>
Author: <strong>Weining Hu</strong><br>
This project used PyTorch to build a CNN model to recognize all types of cells that are present in the given images. These cell types are: red blood cell, difficult, gametocyte, trophozoite, ring, schizont, and leukocyte. The best model over the seven-day data challenge competition (final exam for Machine Learning II) yielded a loss score of 4.54085.

<p align="justify"><strong>2017 Barcelona Traffic Accident Severity Prediction</strong><br>
Authors: Nhung Nguyen and <strong>Weining Hu</strong><br>
This project implemented decision tree, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to explore the determinants of traffic accidents in Barcelona. Particularly, we examined how location, transportation type, time, and unemployment rate are correlated with traffic accidents. Both of the random forest model and the decision tree model yielded a 90% accuracy, achieving better results than KNN.

<p align="justify"><strong>2016 NYC Poverty Studies</strong><br>
Authors: Isaac Amoah, Evan Carraway, Victor Chen, <strong>Weining Hu,</strong> and Tina Nguyen<br>
This project built General Linear Regression model and Random Forest using <i>R</i> as the programming language to predict poverty rate in New York City. The study of poverty is important because it can help decision makers better understand this ongoing problem to break the cycles of poverty and prioritize effective interventions for the most at-risk groups. Our findings show that Income, Unit Population, Family Type, Housing Type and Borough have the strongest predictive power for poverty status. Random forest appears to be a better model in this instance with an AUC score of 0.9 and accuracy score of 84%.

<p align="justify"><strong>2017 Global Merchandise Exports</strong><br>
Author: Weining Hu<br>
This project analyzes the 2017 export data across seven regions in the world. I constructed a chord diagram using D3 to visualize the exports data for all seven regions in the world, making it possible to display how merchandise products were exported from one source region to a destination.
