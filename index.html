<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h2>

<p align="justify">I am a master's student in Data Science at the <a href="https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a> (GWU) under the supervision of <a href="https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/yuxiao-huang">Yuxiao Huang</a> (MS degree anticipated May 2020). I am experienced with data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using programming languages including <em>Python</em> and <em>R</em>. My machine learning expertise focuses on classification algorithms such as Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine; as well as deep learning algorithms including Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). </p>

<p align="justify">Before coming to GWU, I studied both Math and Asian Studies at <a href="https://www.kenyon.edu/">Kenyon College</a> (BA '14), and Asian Political Economy at the School of Foreign Service at <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University</a> (MA '16). From 2016 to 2018, I worked as a business intelligence analyst at two global risk and strategic consulting firms, <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en">Kroll Inc.,</a> (Washington DC, USA) and <a href="https://www.controlrisks.com/">Control Risks</a> (Shanghai, China). Through these experiences, I honed my analytical and writing skills through conducting pre-investment due diligence and political risk assessments for fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>2016 New York City Poverty Studies</strong><br>
<em>Role: EDA, ggplot2 visualization, Logistic Regression implementation, and results assessments</em><br>
This project built Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest using <em>R</em> as the programming language to predict poverty rates in New York City. The findings show that Income, Unit Population, Family Type, Housing Type and Borough have the strongest predictive power for poverty status. Random Forest appears to be a better model in this instance with an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.90 and accuracy score of 84%.

<p align="justify"><strong>2017 Barcelona Traffic Accident Severity Prediction</strong><br>
<em>Role: data cleaning, EDA, and Random Forest implementation</em><br>
This project implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest to explore the determinants of traffic accidents in Barcelona. Particularly, it examined how location, transportation type, time, and unemployment rate are correlated with traffic accidents. Both the Random Forest model and the Decision Tree model yielded a 90% accuracy.

<p align="justify"><strong>Flooding Damage Detection from Post-Harvey Hurricane Satellite Imagery based on CNN</strong><br>
<em>Role: project lead (pre-trained models implementation, performance matrices construction, and report writing)</em><br>
This project desiged and trained a convolutional neural network from scratch and compared it with two existing neural networks, the <em>VGG-16</em> and <em>Resnet50</em>, for a binary classification problem (to differentiate images that contain flooding damages from the ones still intact.) The best model (a custom CNN with fewer convolutional layers) was able to achieve an accuracy score of over 90% on the hold-out test set. The networks were trained using <em>PyTorch</em> as the framework with a single NVIDIA K80 Tesla GPU via the Google Cloud Platform.

<p align="justify"><strong>Malaria Infected Cell Classification via MLP</strong><br>
<em>Role: individual work</em><br>
This project built an MLP model using <em>Keras</em> as the framework to classify the blood cells into 4 different categories, which are: <em>red blood cell</em>, <em>ring</em>, <em>schizont</em>, and <em>trophozoite</em>. The best model over the seven-day data challenge competition (mid-term exam for Machine Learning II) has achieved a reasonable performance with a 0.6147 macro-averaged F1-score and 0.6212 Cohen’s Kappa Score.

<p align="justify"><strong>Multi-Label Classification of Blood Cells Using CNN</strong><br>
<em>Role: individual work</em><br>
This project built a CNN model using <em>PyTorch</em> as the framework to recognize all types of cells that are present in the given images. These cell types are: <em>red blood cell</em>, <em>difficult</em>, <em>gametocyte</em>, <em>trophozoite</em>, <em>ring</em>, <em>schizont</em>, and <em>leukocyte</em>. The best model over the seven-day data challenge competition (final exam for Machine Learning II) yielded a loss score of 4.54085.

<p align="justify"><strong>The 2020 Presidential Race: NLP and Sentimental Analysis of Online News Articles (on-going)</strong><br>
<em>Role: data collection, TF-IDF analysis, bag-of-words modeling</em><br>
This project used TF-IDF techniques to determine the keywords/issues associated with each candidate in news coverage. It also built bag-of-words models to identify authors of the articles, and to classify each news media outlet’s (New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post) sentiment towards the top 3 candidates (Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump). A total of 1350 news articles were scraped using the semi-autormated data collection pipeline Web Scraper.

<p align="justify"><strong>Infectious Disease Outbreaks and Human Migration: A Network Analysis</strong><br>
<em>Role: individual work</em><br>
This project provided a system-level study of human migration movements and infectious disease cases on the same footing. It employed network science theory and data science tools <em>igraph</em> packge to describe the heterogeneous nature of the system, i.e. countries (encoded in the network nodes) and human flows (encoded in the network edges).

<p align="justify"><strong>2017 Global Merchandise Exports Using D3</strong><br>
<em>Role: individual work</em><br>
This project analyzed the 2017 export data across seven regions in the world. A chord diagram was constructed using D3 to visualize the export data for all seven regions in the world, displaying how merchandise products were exported from one source region to a destination.

<em>Role: created a choropleth map, a line chart showing educational attainment difference between male and female, and a filter enabling user to view the data of a specific country</em><br>
This project analyzed the number of school years completed by individuals in the world. By using different interactive techniques and visualization graphics in Tableau, the dashboard presents to the audience the differences in educational attainment apparent in varied regions, income levels, and gender groups in the world.
