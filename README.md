## Introduction
This project analyzes the 2017 export data across seven regions in the world. Although export data has been rigorously explored by many visualization designers, many of these graphics were dislayed as a line chart, bar chart, or pie chart. A major problem with these three types of chart is that the graph only presents the export performance for one single region at a time, making it difficult to visually compare the export performances across all regions simultaneously. In order to overcome this shortcoming, this project uses a chord diagram to visualize the exports data for all seven regions in the world, making it possible to display how merchandise products were exported from one source region to a destination.
